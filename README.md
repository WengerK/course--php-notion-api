## ðŸ§¨ Getting Started

All samples are easily testable in your browser by running the php built-in web server.

```bash
php -S localhost:9000 -t samples/
```

And then browsing to the host and port you specified (in the above example, `http://localhost:9000`).

## ðŸš§ How to run the examples

1. Install the dependencies with Composer:

```bash
$ composer install
```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file in the examples folder as `.env`

```bash
$ cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

3. Fill the `.env` file with correct information

    - `NOTION_WEBMARDI_DATABASE_ID` a Notion database
    - `NOTION_TOKEN` a valid notion Token for the previous Database

4. Run the PHP built-in web server. Supply the `-t` option to this directory:

```bash
$ php -S localhost:9000 -t ./
```
